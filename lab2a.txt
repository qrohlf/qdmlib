After a translation by 2, 1 and a rotation by 225 degrees, followed by a magnification by 2 and then a rotation by -45 degrees and finally a translation by 0, -2 this image is eventually produced.

Accurately draw the original object.

End result:
    Points:
        (2, 0)
        (2, -2)
        (6, 0)
        (6, -2)
        (8, 0)

    Final image is a rectangle with triangle attached
